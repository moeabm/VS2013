to fix... Snipers still face wrong way...

0.52

 issues/todo:
  [] spies still cannot sap (*engine issue?)
  [] demo's cannot set pipe traps (yet)  
  [] bots don't always use teleports (some situations only)

 KNOWN limitations:
  All of these limitations are effects of the Orange Box SDK lack 
  of 3rd party bot support, which are caused by the double speed/double 
  timing issue:
 
    [] bots still cannot crouch 
    [] pyro's flame still does not show
    [] sometimes engineers can't select wrench
     [] other bots sometimes can't select the weapon they want
      [] sometimes bots use melee weapon from long range
    [] soldier rocket jumps are not perfect
    [] scout double jumps are not perfect
    [] bots can still move when bonked
